## Project Summary:
In this project, the data collected from cosmetic companies in California was analyzed to draw conclusions about the frequency of hazardous ingredients and their products. Questions explored included:
- Which companies and brands have the most reports of potentially hazardous chemicals?
- Which potentially hazardous chemicals have been reported the most?
- Which product categories and subcategories contain the most reports of potentially hazardous chemicals?
- What kind of changes were there in the reporting of potentially hazardous chemicals from year to year?

## Methods and Analysis (using Python in Jupyter Notebook)
- Which companies have the highest frequency of hazardous chemicals?

Our analysis reveals that every company reported at least one chemical in their products, 
with the maximum number of chemicals utilized by a single company reaching nine. Notably, 
L'Oréal emerged as the leader in chemical usage, reporting an astonishing total of 5,711 chemicals. However, 
it is crucial to highlight that the predominant chemical in their products is Titanium Dioxide, 
which has been associated with serious health concerns, including DNA damage, skin irritation, 
and carcinogenic effects when inhaled.

Additionally, BareMinerals was identified as the top brand for chemical usage, 
particularly with 3,031 instances of Titanium Dioxide. Given its prevalence in our dataset, 
we aimed to investigate the other chemicals more thoroughly, excluding Titanium Dioxide. 
This deeper analysis led us to discover that Coty is the foremost company in chemical usage when Titanium Dioxide 
is not considered, with retinol being their primary chemical of concern. Retinol is known to have side effects such 
as skin irritation, increased sensitivity to sunlight, and potential teratogenic effects.

Furthermore, our focused analysis on companies producing baby products indicated that Harmon Stores had the highest chemical counts for lead and cadmium.
These heavy metals pose significant risks to child development, with cadmium in particular being linked to autism.

Titanium dioxide was by far the most reported chemical which is very concerning as it is considered a carcinogen when in powdered form. It doesn’t mean all the products that have been reported are in powdered form but it is concerning to have any carcinogen product to put on your skin. The other chemicals have been found to have caused cancer from the graph and at the minimum is skin irritations. We, the consumers should be aware of what we put on our bodies as they affect us for the rest of our lives. The graph informs about chemicals that were allowed in past products for current consumers to throw away.
